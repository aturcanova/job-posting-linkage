    "The Orbis dataset is split into multiple 'topics' resembling SQL tables.\n",
    "Each of the 'topics' is devided into multiple compressed files. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on two parts of the Orbis dataset:\n",
    "1. All Addresses\n",
    "2. BvD ID and Name\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part, _All Addresses_, is composed of 8 compressed files, and \n",
    "the second part, _BvD ID and Name_ is composed of 4 comperssed files.\n",
    "Each of the files takes a few GB of storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the important part of this notebook is to process these files efficiently with regards to memory and space.\n",
    "For that reason, we decided to omit filtering by the 'Country' and joining the dataframes on the ID, as this operation is too expensive.\n",
    "Both of the dataframes are filetered in the same way, based on their only common column 'BvD ID number'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we call two methods to:\n",
    "- Extract Orbis data files.\n",
    "- Filter out columns with unnecessary data.\n",
    "- Save obtained dataframes to .csv files."
